# Email-Alert-System
This project implements an Email Alert System integrated with WhatsApp to notify users of important emails in real time. The system improves response time by delivering critical email alerts directly to WhatsApp using automation and messaging APIs.
For the vast majority of people who use the internet, using email as their primary method of professional communication has quickly become the norm. In the recent past, there has been a rise in the number of people using email, which has led to an increase in the number of difficulties that are produced by spam emails. The practice of sending large numbers of unsolicited messages in bulk is referred to as spam or junk email. On the other hand, emails that are meaningful but have an opposite tendency are referred to as "Ham." 
A typical email subscriber receives between 40 and 50 messages each day on average. Every year, spammers bring in an estimated $3.5 million USD from their activities, causing financial harm to recipients on both the individual and the institutional level. As a consequence of this, the users invest a considerable amount of their working time in responding to these emails. According to reports, spam accounts for more than fifty percent of the traffic on email servers and is responsible for the transmission of a large number of uninvited and unwanted bulk emails. They reduce productivity by using user resources while producing little of value in return. 
The purpose of the marketing purposes that are intended to unfold malevolent criminal acts such as identity theft, financial disturbances, stealing sensitive information, and reputational damage that is carried out by spammers that disseminate spam has this objective. Email management and the categorization of spam emails are key necessities for enterprises in order for them to boost their production and reduce the financial losses they incur as a result of decreased output.
The project involves setting up an email alert system integrated with WhatsApp. This system aims to provide timely notification via WhatsApp message based on specific events triggered through email. The background includes the need for efficient communication and real-time updates, while the basic would entail establishing an email parsing mechanism to detect relevant events and configuring a WhatsApp API for message delivery. Additionally, considering for security, scalability and customization would be essential for a robust implementation.
